Photo Gallery using React 

Version 1:
This react application has the following structure :

index.js (entry point)
  |
  |
PhotoGallery.js (logic / smart component)
  |
  |
Image.js (render individual images)


Bootstrap has been used in addition to the normalized css . 



Version 2: (using LightBox)
LightBox has been used for neat animations of swiping between images .It also fits the requirements asked for this question where the images have to an array and the caption has to be over the image.

By using Lightbox, the code is also optimized and there s just one component used .
